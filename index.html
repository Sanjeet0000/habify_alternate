            <span class="first_letter">W</span>e live in very peculiar times.
            Our preceding generations were plagued by countless illnesses that
            couldn’t be cured due to a lack of scientific advancement. While
            technology has now made it possible to cure even the deadliest
            disease, the present generation suffers an even graver danger:
            Mental Illness. According to the CDC, worldwide, one in eight people
            suffer from a diagnosed mental illness. In the USA, it’s one in
            four, and in India, it’s one in fourteen. Our country sees a student
            committing suicide every hour. In 2020 alone, India saw 1.53 lakh
            people die due to suicide; that’s equal to the number of victims
            that succumbed to COVID-19. And this is only the tip of the iceberg.
            Now, the first question you may ask is: “Why didn’t they get any
            help?” Well, there are two main reasons for this.
          </p>
          <ul style="padding-left: 10vw">
            <li>People don’t want to seek help.</li>
            <li>People can’t get help.</li>

          According to research, a staggering 47% of Indians believe that mental
          illnesses didn’t require additional treatment; a further 26% were
          afraid to be diagnosed with one. Then what about the minority of
          people that wanted to get treatment, you ask? Simply put, they
          couldn’t. The number of psychiatrists in India is a miniscule 9000. A
          population of 141 crore, (of which more than 60% is below the age of
          35 and sometimes the sole breadwinner of a family) has only 1 mental
          health professional for every 11,031 people. To put that into
          perspective, during the second wave of COVID-19, there was only one
          doctor available for every 1,500 patients. The medical system in India
          was in shambles overnight. Imagine one doctor looking after 10 times
          as many patients, all at once. This is not a hypothetical situation.
          Experts believe that if the mental health scene in India doesn’t
          change, more than 80% of the population will suffer from a diagnosable
          mental illness.

          Our approach is different from what is currently out there. If mental
          health was a horizon between point A and point Z, we need the
          intervention of a counsellor, psychologist, therapist, or psychiatrist
          somewhere around point K. Habify tries to address the issue before a
          person reaches point K. Through the Emotional First Aid Academy, we
          create a frontline of Emotional First Aid providers called Enablers.

          Ask yourself: Have you, or anyone close to you, experienced mental
          stress, loneliness, or worse? If you have, then you can understand why
          Habify is here to make a positive impact on the world and the people
          in it.

            <h1>At the Forefront of Mental Wellness</h1>
            <p class="py-3">
              Modern problems require modern solutions. Since the traditional
              systems of communication and community seem to have dissipated, we
              see a startling rise in the cases of mental health issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are passionate about bringing conversations back into the fold.
              At the EFA Academy, the idea is to stem the tide of loneliness
              with a tête-à-tête. These private interactions not only provide a
              much-needed confidante but also stand to break the taboo of
              talking about mental health.

            <h1>We are Unparalleled</h1>
            <p class="py-3">
              While we believe that technology can allow us to achieve more in
              every aspect of life, we firmly believe that human connection and
              compassion remain crucial when it comes to healing the mind. There
              is no doubt that there is a growing recognition within the
              international community that mental health is to be treated as a
              non-communicable condition. At Habify, we keep it simple. We focus
              on the strengths rather than deal with the weaknesses of the mind.

          <h1>Connecting People</h1>
          <p>
            Not everyone needs therapy, but all of us at some point need someone
            to talk to. Even though technology is more ingrained in every phase
            of life, we are not advocating that those innovations and
            technologies should replace human intervention. On the contrary, we
            envision the adoption of technology as a supplement—to ensure that
            anyone can find a trusty person to confide in and share their
            everyday stories, nuggets, and the burden of being human—at an
            affordable cost.

            We’re a bunch of people who identify as ‘humans’. Together, we are
            makers, thinkers, foodies, habit-builders and bathroom singers. We
            approach work and play with curiosity and experimentation (sometimes
            with sarcasm and wit), using what we learn to create a meaningful
            community that connects with people, just like you. We believe that
            mental health is a birth right. Each day we strive to do our part to
            make the world a little less lonely. After all, our minds are the
            only place in which we truly live.
